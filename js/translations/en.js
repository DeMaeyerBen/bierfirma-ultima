  aboutUsText: 'We are 4 friends with a passion for brewing and recipe development. Out of that passion, we currently created 3 beers: a blond honey beer with an alcohol percentage of 6%, an Exotic Triple with 8% of alcohol and lastly a Barley Wine containing 10% of alcohol. With these beers we want to leave our mark on the large beer market in Belgium. Owning a brewery may still be a long way off, but hopefully somewhere in the future.',
