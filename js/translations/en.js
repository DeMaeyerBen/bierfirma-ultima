  aboutUsText: 'We are 4 friends with a passion for brewing and recipe development. From this we currently created 3 beers. A blond honey beer with 7% alcohol, an Exotic Triple with a 8% of alcohol and finally a Barley Wine with 10% of alcohol. With these beers we want to make our mark on the large beer market in Belgium. Owning a brewery may still be a long way off, but is certainly not non-existing.',
